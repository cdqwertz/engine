#cdqwertz's game engine
This is my simple js game engine. It is still WIP.
The main goal of this game engine is to simplify developing games a lot.

Just try it out :D

###Editor
I am working on a game editor. This game editor will make developing games a lot easier, because you dont need to learn programming. The editor is still WIP.
It will also include a level editor.
